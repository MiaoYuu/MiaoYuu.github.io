Hi! I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems at the Faculty of Business and Economics (IIM), the University of Hong Kong. My advisor is [Prof.Hailiang Chen](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/hailiang-chen/). Broadly, I am interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital platforms, and FinTech. Leveraging econometric models, field experiments, and advanced machine learning techniques, I strive to understand and enhance human-AI collaboration in the ever-evolving landscape of the future of work. Right now, I use design science methods and online experiments to study human-LLM interactions in service contexts.
