I am a PhD candidate in Information Systems at the The University of Hong Kong. My advisor is Hailiang Chen. Broadly, I am interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital platforms, and FinTech. Leveraging econometric models, field and online experiments, and advanced machine learning techniques, I strive to understand and enhance the well-being of stakeholders in the ever-evolving landscape of the future of work. I am currently using design science methods and online experiments to study human-AI interactions in service contexts.</p> </body></html>
